## Javascript and classes
- Yes, JavaScript has classes. Starting with ECMAScript 6 (ES6), JavaScript introduced 
  the class syntax as a more intuitive and cleaner way to define constructor functions 
  and work with objects. Although JavaScript classes are primarily syntactic sugar over 
  the existing prototype-based inheritance, they make it easier to understand and write 
  object-oriented code.
